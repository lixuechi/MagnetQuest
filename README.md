MagnetQuest
===========
Magnet Quest is a 2D platformer game. Under the background of a pyramid, stars, water drops and devils are flying around the screen. As a magnet ball, you should eat as many stars as possible to gain your score, but you should also avoid devils for they will slow down your speed and make you dumber by enlarging your size. You should really be careful of the devils because when your speed is down to 0, the game is over. A helpful way to clean up your body of harmful devils is to eat the water drops, by then your status will be restored.
